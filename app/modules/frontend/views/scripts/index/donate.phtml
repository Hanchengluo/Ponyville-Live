<p>
    The Ponyville Live! network is a not-for-profit operation, and makes no revenue from its convention coverage, radio, video or podcast syndication services.<br>
    We depend on the support of our community to help us bring you the best in pony media.
</p>

<h2>Why Donate?</h2>

<p>
    Ponyville Live! is more than just a web site. We build and maintain a huge network to bring you the best of pony media all day, every day.<br>
    In addition to our own homepage, we also maintain the following services:

        <h3>Web Hosting</h3>

        <p>PVL provides free-of-charge hosting for a number of our radio stations and video streams. We also host the databases powering not only our own homepage, but also third-party apps like HoofSounds.</p>

        <h3>Radio Station Hosting</h3>

        <p>Eight of PVL's radio stations are hosted on the Ponyville Live! radio server. Just like web hosting, we provide a fully-licensed CentovaCast station completely free of charge to the stations who use it.</p>

        <h3>Convention Coverage</h3>

        <p>The PVL press teams cover conventions from across the globe, and we never charge conventions for our recording or streaming services. Sending our cameras and staff to conventions is by far our largest expense.</p>
