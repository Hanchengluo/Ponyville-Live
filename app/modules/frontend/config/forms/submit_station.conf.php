                        <p>We are honored that your station is interested in joining the Ponyville Live family. For over a year, the Ponyville Live (or, as we call it, PVL) network of stations has delivered countless hours of live programming, 24/7 radio stations, video streams, convention coverage, and more to Bronies across the world.</p>

                        <p><b>The PVL Promise:</b> Joining the PVL family of radio stations brings your station to a whole new audience, without sacrificing your station\'s independence or creativity. We do not influence the scheduling, staffing, or content of your station (as long as it\'s legal). Our goal is to give you and your team the opportunities and exposure that large stations would receive, but without needing to build an audience from scratch.</p>

                        <p>In order for us to add your station to our web site, plugins, and apps, we need some information about your station. This information also helps our existing station administrators determine if your station is a good fit for the network.</p>

                        <p><b>All new stations joining PVL must be approved by the existing station leaders.</b> This process may take a week or two after you have submitted your station. If you don\'t get voted in the first time, though, don\'t worry; our team will let you know any feedback they have, and you can always request that the team re-vote on your station after you have made any changes.</p>

                        <p>If you have any questions about the new station submission process, just contact our leadership at <a href="mailto:pr@ponyvillelive.com">pr@ponyvillelive.com</a>. Thank you again for your submission, and we look forward to working with you and your team!</p>
